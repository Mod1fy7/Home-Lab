## Virtual Machines Used

| WHAT             | WHY                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| pfSense          | Virtual firewall/router                  |
| Windows Server   | Active Directory, DNS, DHCP              |
| Windows 10       | Domain-joined client                     |
| Kali Linux       | Penetration testing                      |
| Ubuntu Server    | Web server / Log collection / SIEM       |
| ELK / Wazuh Stack| Centralized logging & monitoring         |
