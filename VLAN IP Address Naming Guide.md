Got it üëç you want a **general, stripped-down guide** (no deep pfSense/VirtualBox details), just the core idea of how to set IPs so devices live on the same network (or different ones with VLANs). Here‚Äôs the most general version:

# üåê General Guide: Setting IPs & VLANs

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Decide Your Networks

* Pick a subnet for each group (VLAN). Example:

  * VLAN 10 ‚Üí `192.168.10.0/24`
  * VLAN 20 ‚Üí `192.168.20.0/24`

Each VLAN needs its own range of IPs.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assign Gateways

* Every subnet has a **gateway** (usually the router/firewall). Example:

  * VLAN 10 gateway = `192.168.10.1`
  * VLAN 20 gateway = `192.168.20.1`

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Give Devices IPs

* Each device in a VLAN must:

  1. Have a **unique IP** in that subnet.
  2. Use the subnet‚Äôs **gateway**.

Examples:

* Device A in VLAN 10 ‚Üí IP `192.168.10.11`, gateway `192.168.10.1`
* Device B in VLAN 10 ‚Üí IP `192.168.10.12`, gateway `192.168.10.1`
* Device C in VLAN 20 ‚Üí IP `192.168.20.21`, gateway `192.168.20.1`

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Connectivity Rules

* Devices in the **same subnet** (same VLAN) can talk to each other directly.
* Devices in **different subnets** (different VLANs) need a router/firewall to talk across.

---

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it ‚Äî the general recipe:

1. Pick subnets.
2. Assign gateways.
3. Give devices IPs in the right range.
4. Same subnet = direct talk, different subnets = router needed.

Do you want me to make a **one-page cheat sheet diagram** that shows this visually?
